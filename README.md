# Eat Da Burger

## Description
The goal of this app is for the user to be able to create a list of burgers to eat and signify which burgers have been eaten.  This app uses a mySQL database to store information and Handlebars to generate dynamic HTML/CSS.

## Installation
The user can navigate to https://shrouded-forest-31453.herokuapp.com/ and begin using the app immediately from there.
